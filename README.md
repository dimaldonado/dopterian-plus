# Dopterian-Plus

Simulates how galaxies would appear at higher redshifts, accounting for angular 
resolution degradation, surface brightness dimming, and wavelength shifts. The process 
integrates PSFs for both redshifts, photometric band adjustments, and optional evolutionary 
corrections to produce realistic observational conditions at the target redshift.

## Installation

To install Dopterian-Plus, run the following command:

```bash
pip install dopterian-plus 
```
