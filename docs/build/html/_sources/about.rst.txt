About Dopterian+
====================

Dopterian+ simulates how galaxies would appear at higher redshifts, accounting for angular 
resolution degradation, surface brightness dimming, and wavelength shifts. The process integrates 
PSFs for both redshifts, photometric band adjustments, and optional evolutionary corrections to produce 
realistic observational conditions at the target redshift.

Installation
------------

To install Dopterian+, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install dopterian-plus
